# Project Name: Brent - Multi-Asset Token Purchaser

## Project Overview
The Brent agent aims to automate the purchase of multiple tokens from Uniswap in a single transaction. It operates on both Polygon and Base Chains, utilizing elizaOS for its backend and integrating with Uniswap's API for transactions.

## Short Project Description
Brent: An AI-Powered Multi-Asset Token Purchaser. Automates token purchases on Uniswap across multiple chains, enabling efficient, streamlined transactions.

## Long Project Description
**Objective**: Develop an intelligent agent capable of purchasing multiple tokens from Uniswap in a single transaction, leveraging cross-chain functionality on Polygon and Base Chains.

## Key Features
- **Token Search**: Query tokens by name or address.
- **Project Description Generation**: Provide detailed information about each token's project.
- **Uniswap Pair Discovery**: Identify matching pairs for token purchases.
- **Liquidity Validation**: Check metrics like volume and slippage to ensure transactions are feasible.
- **Transaction Preparation**: Craft multi-token transactions with optimal parameters.
- **Target Chains**: Polygon and Base Chain (BSC).

## Technical Overview

### Development Stack
- **Backend**: Next.js
